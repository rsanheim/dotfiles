* after installing iterm2, need to change your profile to launch in Rosetta2 by default:
  * iterm2 -> Preferences -> Profiles -> General
  * enter `arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/bash --login`
  * open a new shell to verify:
    * `echo $SHELL` should return the correct path to your shell
    * `arch` should return `i386`
